PC-LISP
=======

By Peter Ashwood-Smith

PC-LISP is a portable Franz Lisp dialect interpreter and compiler,
written in C, that is portable to 32 & 64 bit Linux, Mac, and Windows.

The main home for this system is:  https://github.com/blakemcbride/PC-LISP

Porting and updating done by Blake McBride (blake1024@gmail.com)

Currently tested on 64 bit Linux, Mac, and 32 & 64 bit Windows.

The system also includes a manual and the original Franz Lisp manual
for reference.

See: BUILD.txt

Forked a copy to my repository with thanks to Blake for porting it to more modern Windows systems.
